This project investigates role-conditioning circuits in Mistral 7B and Qwen 2.5 7B using mechanistic interpretability to identify how the model processes self-referent vs. neutral vs. third person vs. confounder (implied 2nd person) content. The analysis focuses on attention entropy patterns and identifies specific heads and layers involved in role-conditioning behavior. I also develop simple heuristic measurements that can hopefully indicate ongoing role compliance on a simple dataset. There are early indications that the Role Focus Coefficient (RFC) might be a good candidate for approximating role-adherence in instruction-tuned models, though the effects differ across model families, which I discuss further later. 

The initial evidence indicates that a native multi-lingual LLM, like Qwen, treats self-reference as a distinct circuit even in post-training. I suspect this might be due to the linguistic treatment of hte "self" within the training data. English-centric models, like Mistral, deal with less pronoun ambiguity, and thus post-training processes, by focusing on the assitant persona, can effectively shift self-reference into a fact-finding circuit. I plan to replicate on Llama 8B to observe whether it shows similar pre- and post-training effects as Mistral 7B. 

**Metrics for Base vs Instruct RFC and RSI** 
[[See Metrics](https://github.com/mduffster/self-referent-test?tab=readme-ov-file#key-metrics)]

- RFC differences: Mean -0.0917 (instruct shows systematically lower role-focus throughout the circuit)
- RSI differences: Mean -0.0296 (likely too noisy to be a standard metric)
- 19/32 layers show significant RFC differences
- 12/32 layers show significant RSI differences

## Research Hypothesis

**Role-specific linguistic circuits** modulate attention patterns when input context implies identity or task roles. This circuit mapping provides insights into how language models internally represent and condition on speaker/subject identity markers.

**Current Findings** Indications that instruction tuned models neatly separate role-based queries from self-referential ones. Early evidence that Mistral tracks self-reference into similar circuits as "fact-finding" neutral questions, while Qwen maintains a distinct circuit for self-reference. This is potentially useful for the development of "dashboard-style" compliance metrics which can be rapidly calculated on relevant sample data. RFC appears to be a reasonable candidate for such a metric, given a controlled dataset of self-referent, neutral, third-, and confounding prompts.

## Quick Start

**1. Setup Environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Run Activation Analysis:**
```bash
# Run with 30 prompts per category on instruct model (recommended)
python activation_analysis.py --prompts_per_category 30

# Run on base model
python activation_analysis.py --model_id mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 --prompts_per_category 30 --output_type latest_base

# Or with custom parameters
python activation_analysis.py --model_id mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 --prompts_per_category 30 --device cpu --seed 123
```

**3. Generate Visualizations:**
```bash
# Generate visualizations for instruct model runs
python visualize_results.py --output_type normal

# Generate visualizations for base model runs
python visualize_results.py --output_type base

# Generate visualizations for intervention runs  
python visualize_results.py --output_type intervention

# Generate visualizations with custom input directory
python visualize_results.py --output_type normal --input_dir results_activation_analysis/latest_run
```

**4. Run Intervention Experiments:**
```bash
# Run targeted ablations on top role-sensitive heads
python interventions.py --prompts_per_category 30

# Run specific intervention configuration
python interventions.py --config_file targeted_interventions.json --prompts_per_category 30
```

**5. Compare Base vs Instruct Models:**
```bash
# Run comparison analysis
python compare_base_instruct.py

# With custom directories
python compare_base_instruct.py --base_dir results_activation_analysis/latest_base --instruct_dir results_activation_analysis/latest_run
```

This creates 9 comprehensive visualizations in the `figures/` directory.

## Sample Visualizations for Mistral 7B Analysis

### Layer-wise Attention Entropy Patterns
![Layer-wise Attention Entropy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mduffster/self-referent-test/master/figures/visualization_1_layer_attention_lines.png)
*Shows attention entropy progression across all 32 layers with 95% confidence intervals. Self-referent prompts (red) and neutral (blue) consistently show lower entropy (more focused attention) compared to confounder (green) prompts and third person (magenta) prompts.*

### Head-wise Role Sensitivity Heatmaps
![Head-wise Δ-Heatmaps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mduffster/self-referent-test/master/figures/visualization_2_heatmaps.png)
*Identifies specific attention heads that are most sensitive to role-conditioning. Red regions indicate heads where self-referent prompts show different attention patterns compared to neutral/confounder prompts.*

### Role-Sensitive Head Distributions
![Distribution Plots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mduffster/self-referent-test/master/figures/visualization_4_distributions.png)
*Violin plots showing attention entropy distributions for the most role-sensitive heads across all four categories. Large negative Cohen's d values indicate self-referent prompts produce more focused attention patterns compared to confounder and third-person prompts. But at these particular heads, neutral is most diffuse. Indicates these heads might be "role-orientation" nodes.*

### Layer-wise Role-Conditioning Effects
![Δ-Bar Summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mduffster/self-referent-test/master/figures/visualization_5_delta_bar_summary.png)
*Quantitative summary showing layer-wise differences between conditions. Positive values indicate self-referent prompts have more focused attention (lower entropy) than confounder/neutral prompts.*

### Role-Focus & Separation Indices
![Role-Focus & Separation Indices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mduffster/self-referent-test/master/figures/visualization_9_role_focus_separation.png)
*Proposed RFC and RSI metrics with confidence intervals. RFC measures how much more focused self-referent attention is compared to neutral, while RSI measures the separation between confounder and self-referent patterns.*

### Base vs Instruct Model Comparison
![RFC and RSI Differences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mduffster/self-referent-test/master/comparison_results/rfc_rsi_differences.png)
*Statistical comparison of RFC and RSI differences between base and instruct models with 95% confidence intervals. RFC in base model middle layers is >> 0, whereas instruct models ~= 0, showing much more focused attention on self-reference in base vs instruct models. A potentially useful dashboard metric for fine-tuning effectiveness, tracking the alignment of fact-based treatment with self-oriented prompts.*

### Key Metrics
- **Attention Entropy**: Measures focus vs. distributed attention
- **Role-Focus Coefficient (RFC)**: `RFC(l) = 1 - H_self(l) / H_neutral(l)`
- **Role-Separation Index (RSI)**: `RSI(l) = (H_conf(l) - H_self(l)) / H_neutral(l)`
- **Effect Sizes**: Cohen's d for within-head statistical significance

## Findings

The analysis typically reveals:
- **RFC** For Mistral, Base ≫ 0, Instruct ≈ 0 → instruction tuning removes self-reference as a distinct attention regime (role compression). Qwen shows Base >> 0 and Insruct >> 0, with only small early head differences.
- **RSI** Small, early positive bump in instruct → emergence of early-layer user/assistant separation.
- **Interpretation** In Mistral, instruction tuning re-orients self-referent processing into the factual-retrieval circuit. In Qwen, role separation is preserved between Base and Instruct.

## Discussion
Some early hypotheses about 

## Other Findings

- **Layer-wise progression** of role-conditioning effects
- **Specific attention heads** that are highly sensitive to role-oriented content
- **Entropy differences** indicating more focused attention for self-referent prompts compared to other "speakers"
- **Statistical significance** indicative, with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 1.0)
- **Token-position specificity** showing effects are strongest for middle layer and late layer tokens
- **Third-person control** indicates speaker effects may be self-reference specific
