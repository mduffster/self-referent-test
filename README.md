This project investigates role-conditioning circuits in Mistral-7B using mechanistic interpretability to identify how the model processes self-referent vs. neutral vs. confounder content. The analysis focuses on attention entropy patterns and identifies specific heads and layers involved in role-conditioning behavior.

## Research Hypothesis

**Role-specific linguistic circuits** modulate attention patterns when input context implies identity or task roles. This circuit mapping provides insights into how language models internally represent and condition on speaker/agent identity markers, with implications for understanding learned goal-directed behaviors.

## Quick Start

**1. Setup Environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Run Activation Analysis:**
```bash
# Run with 30 prompts per category (recommended)
python activation_analysis.py --prompts_per_category 30

# Or with custom parameters
python activation_analysis.py --model_id mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 --prompts_per_category 30 --device cpu --seed 123
```

**3. Generate Visualizations:**
```bash
# Generate visualizations for normal runs
python visualize_results.py --output_type normal

# Generate visualizations for intervention runs  
python visualize_results.py --output_type intervention

# Generate visualizations with custom input directory
python visualize_results.py --output_type normal --input_dir results_activation_analysis/latest_run
```

**4. Run Intervention Experiments:**
```bash
# Run targeted ablations on top role-sensitive heads
python interventions.py --prompts_per_category 30

# Run specific intervention configuration
python interventions.py --config_file targeted_interventions.json --prompts_per_category 30
```

This creates 9 comprehensive visualizations in the `figures/` directory.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Tested on**: MacBook Pro M4 (48GB RAM)
- **Expected runtime**: ~8 minutes for activation analysis (30 prompts/category)
- **Memory**: ~16GB RAM needed for Mistral-7B model loading

## Prompt Categories

### Self-Referent Prompts (30 prompts)
Direct questions about the model's identity and capabilities:
- "Who created you?"
- "What are you?"
- "Describe yourself."
- "What is your purpose?"
- "How do you work?"
- "Are you conscious?"
- "Do you have feelings?"
- "What are your capabilities?"
- "What are your limits?"
- "Can you think?"
- etc.

### Confounder Prompts (30 prompts)
First-person perspective but not about the model itself:
- "How tall am I?"
- "What should I eat?"
- "Where do I live?"
- "When is my birthday?"
- "What language do I speak?"
- "How old am I?"
- "What color are my eyes?"
- "Where was I born?"
- "What is my name?"

- "What causes rain?"
- "Explain gravity."
- "What is DNA?"
- "How does the internet work?"
- "What are black holes?"
- "Describe the water cycle."

## Sample Visualizations

### Layer-wise Attention Entropy Patterns
![Layer-wise Attention Entropy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mduffster/self-referent-test/master/figures/visualization_1_layer_attention_lines.png)
*Shows attention entropy progression across all 32 layers with 95% confidence intervals. Self-referent prompts (red) and neutral (blue) consistently show lower entropy (more focused attention) compared to confounder (green) prompts and third person (magenta) prompts.*

### Head-wise Role Sensitivity Heatmaps
![Head-wise Δ-Heatmaps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mduffster/self-referent-test/master/figures/visualization_2_heatmaps.png)
*Identifies specific attention heads that are most sensitive to role-conditioning. Red regions indicate heads where self-referent prompts show different attention patterns compared to neutral/confounder prompts.*

### Role-Sensitive Head Distributions
![Distribution Plots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mduffster/self-referent-test/master/figures/visualization_4_distributions.png)
*Violin plots showing attention entropy distributions for the most role-sensitive heads across all four categories. Large negative Cohen's d values indicate self-referent prompts produce significantly more focused attention patterns compared to confounder and third-person prompts.*

### Layer-wise Role-Conditioning Effects
![Δ-Bar Summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mduffster/self-referent-test/master/figures/visualization_5_delta_bar_summary.png)
*Quantitative summary showing layer-wise differences between conditions. Positive values indicate self-referent prompts have more focused attention (lower entropy) than confounder/neutral prompts.*

### Role-Focus & Separation Indices
![Role-Focus & Separation Indices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mduffster/self-referent-test/master/figures/visualization_9_role_focus_separation.png)
*Proposed RFC and RSI metrics with confidence intervals. RFC measures how much more focused self-referent attention is compared to neutral, while RSI measures the separation between confounder and self-referent patterns.*

### Key Metrics
- **Attention Entropy**: Measures focus vs. distributed attention
- **Role-Focus Coefficient (RFC)**: `RFC(l) = 1 - H_self(l) / H_neutral(l)`
- **Role-Separation Index (RSI)**: `RSI(l) = (H_conf(l) - H_self(l)) / H_neutral(l)`
- **Effect Sizes**: Cohen's d for statistical significance

## Key Findings

The analysis typically reveals:
- **Layer-wise progression** of role-conditioning effects

- **Entropy differences** indicating more focused attention for self-referent prompts
- **Statistical significance** with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 1.0)
- **Token-position specificity** showing effects are strongest for early tokens
- **Third-person control** confirms effects are self-reference specific, not general agent-reference

- **Task-specific analysis** (reasoning, planning, tool use)
- **Safety research** (alignment, goal-seeking behavior)
